Analogue Sauce - The Open Source Sauce
     I needed to create an OS to go on the Raspberry Pi Zero Nintendo hybrid I had recently knocked up, so this got me thinking we need an OS that is designed to deliver SD or lower content for backward compatibility with old analogue equipment, With this distribution and a handful of bucks a complete solution for catering for more mature technologies can be built. 

Introducing Project Analogue Sauce.

      Analogue Sauce is initially an operating system targeted at the Raspberry Pi Zero. providing a Quiet Boot environment aimed at the analogue video out capabilities of the device, this coupled with a web based configuration to allow you to create your own subsystem of teletext pages to be added to video playback of SD (standard definition) content on the 'TV' output of the Raspberry Pi Zero. This source can be modulated for RF transmission providing a signal for post modern equipment for test or display.
